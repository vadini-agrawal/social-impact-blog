![Ethics in Tech](https://github.com/vadini-agrawal/image-repository/blob/master/images/tech-hand.jpg?raw=true "Tech and humanity")

The ethical implications of technological innovation are becoming more and more apparent to us everyday. Whether the discussion is centered around data privacy or workers rights, there is a push towards holding technology accountable, something that I believe will be crucial to societal advancement. 

## Why this blog? :thinking:

I've started this blog as a way to document innovative technologies that are being used or could potentially be used as a force for widespread social impact. I define social impact as something that uplifts people and makes the human condition more equitable for all. 

With my experiences learning about the social enterprise space, I noticed there is a gap between how nonprofits approach technology, and how technologists approach nonprofits. Nonprofits might not have the bandwidth for high growth or technology enablement, while technology firms engage in social impact indirectly via CSR and view nonprofits as slow. 

I believe that there is a middle ground between these two worlds that is slowly emerging, but hugely untapped. That is why I am dedicating this blog to analyzing technologies built for potential social impact, looking at their scalability but also understanding all of the implications they might have on especially vulnerable people. 

## What is the purpose of this project? :earth_americas:
I started this blog mostly as a passion project for myself, to explore organizations and work that I find interesting, while also applying product sense to understanding a technology and its use cases. I hope this information is also useful to the many students out there who are interested in impactful careers in technology, or that this blog is inspiring to those who just want to see more positive work coming out of all the innovation in our time.
