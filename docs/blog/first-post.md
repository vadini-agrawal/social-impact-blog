# Libra: A Currency for All
July 16, 2019 

On June 18, 2019, Facebook and 28 other organizations boldly announced their intentions to empower billions of people with a unified digital global currency. This digital global currency is Libra, a blockchain-esque solution to be integrated with Facebook products to give people access to digital money around the world. It is a novel application of a technology similar to blockchain that would disrupt the government-based currency systems around the world. However, I want to dive deeper into the considerations that Libra should be held accountable to, given how it would affect our lives and economies. 

In a perfect world, Libra could solve a lot of problems. As Mark Zuckerberg quoted himself, around 1 billion people today have a phone but no bank account. This is problematic, as financial services are what drive development by allowing for investment in health, education, and business. They allow for better management of financial emergencies, such as job loss or a crop failure, that can leave vulnerable families in poverty. A study in Kenya showed that with access to mobile money, Kenyan women saved a fifth more and were able to develop businesses, ultimately reducing extreme poverty by 22% for women-led households. Digital financial services would also reduce corruption. In India, pension payment leakage dropped 47% when made through biometric smart cards [(World Bank)](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/332881525873182837/pdf/126033-PUB-PUBLIC-pubdate-4-19-2018.pdf). Digital financial services could add $3.7 trillion to developing economies [(McKinsey)](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Employment%20and%20Growth/How%20digital%20finance%20could%20boost%20growth%20in%20emerging%20economies/MGI-Digital-Finance-For-All-Executive-summary-September-2016.ashx).

Even for developed economies, physical money is slowing us down. Eighty-five percent of the world's transactions are still taking place with cash [(HBR)](https://hbr.org/2016/05/the-countries-that-would-profit-most-from-a-cashless-world). Americans spend 28 minutes a month getting it. The unbanked are hit the hardest, paying $4 higher for cash access. Not to mention the amount of loss businesses face due to cash theft, a hefty $40 billion, the brunt of which is born by mom-and-pop shops [(HBR)](https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-hidden-costs-of-cash).

A global currency could enable people to make international transactions without a significant remittance paid to a middleman, which currently costs 7% of a transaction [(HBR)](https://hbr.org/2016/05/the-countries-that-would-profit-most-from-a-cashless-world). It could accelerate the globalization of business and work. It would make it easier than ever for people to send loved ones money when they work in a different country, as is the case for migrant workers or immigrants. Migrant workers from the Asian-Pacific region sent over $256 billion internationally in 2017 alone, and assuming they paid 7% on that sum, these workers lost $17.92 billion altogether while working often middle-to-low skilled jobs [(Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-remittances/migrant-workers-sent-256-billion-home-to-asia-pacific-last-year-un-idUSKBN1I81WV). This money is going to large money transfer agencies, instead of into the wallets of people who need it the most. 
 
A global digital currency thus has the potential to benefit the world, based on the above problems we currently face. However, Libra can only actually empower billions of people if it is built ethically and is accessible universally. The problems it touts to solve will not be solved with a solution targeting only developed economies and wealthy people. Internet infrastructure must be present and reliable to support a global digital economy. This is still not true in many rural areas and in some developing countries, although projects like [SpaceX’s Starlink](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/12/elon-musk-spacexs-first-starlink-internet-satellites-launch-ready.html) are working on this. In addition, the user experience for the Libra platform must be accessible for those who have low literacy and numeracy, or speak more obscure world languages [(World Bank)](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/332881525873182837/pdf/126033-PUB-PUBLIC-pubdate-4-19-2018.pdf). This could be challenging if Libra is present only within Facebook services; on the flipside, Facebook’s immense resources could enable this if accessibility is prioritized.

Another concern is safety. Consumers must be protected on the platform, where laundering and illegal activity might be easier due to anonymity [(The Verge)](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18716326/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-blockchain-irs-starbucks). Consumers must also have the ability to cash out, since businesses can often take time to implement digital payroll [(World Bank)](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/332881525873182837/pdf/126033-PUB-PUBLIC-pubdate-4-19-2018.pdf). Libra's whitepapers do not completely address these issues, other than vaguely mentioning that Libra would eventually have physical ATM locations where it can be exchanged for local currency. The project is in its infancy, as far as the public knows, but its execution could make or break its ability to democratize financial access. 

The efficacy of Libra get more complicated in how it is actually built, and who is building it.
 
It is a form of stablecoin, a more stable type of cryptocurrency. It is backed by around $1 billion in fiat currencies, legal tender backed by a government, and low risk securities [(TechCrunch)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/facebook-libra-launch/amp/). This makes Libra less volatile, but not necessarily completely stable. Due to IRS regulations on cryptocurrency, any profits made due to a change in Libra’s value would be taxable, making it a costlier option than pure currency [(The Verge)](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18716326/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-blockchain-irs-starbucks). This is a complexity that is not fully addressed in the white papers, so we will have to wait and see how it is addressed in its development. 

In terms of governance, Libra.org is a nonprofit, but multiple organizations have paid money to have a say in Libra. More technically, they paid money to be able to validate transactions on the network [(TechCrunch)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/facebook-libra-launch/amp/). These organizations notably include Facebook, Stripe, Ebay, Lyft, Uber, Coinbase, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, and social enterprise Kiva [(Libra)](https://www.libra.org/). Thus, Libra is centralized, which could create tensions in priorities between what is best for the leading organizations versus what is best for the general public. The network is aimed to become decentralized eventually, but a firm deadline for this is not given [(Forbes)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2019/06/20/libra-an-interesting-idea-if-only-facebook-werent-involved/#6df154777458). If it fails to do so, a few corporations could be controlling a large portion of global transactions, which could lead to a oligopolization that harms Libras consumers financially or otherwise. Although it is hard to say right now what direction Libra will end up taking, it is something to watch out for as the organization grows in power.

The currency would primarily be transferred over Facebook products, like Messenger, and overseen by an organization, Calibra, that is a sort of connector between Libra and Facebook. It was created to separate users’ financial information from the social information found in Facebook [(Libra)](https://www.libra.org/). However, Facebook has huge incentive to utilize the transaction data to build better profiles of its users for advertisers, and with its reputation around data, many experts are not sure they trust Facebook with data from Libra. One of Libra’s founders even testified recently that “[E]xcept in limited circumstances, such as preventing fraud or criminal activity and complying with the law, Calibra will not share customers’ account information or financial data with Facebook unless people agree to permit such sharing” [(Forbes)](https://qz.com/1666630/facebooks-david-marcus-testifies-before-the-senate-on-libra/). This raises questions about Facebook designing the Libra interface to make it difficult to opt out of sharing financial data, as Facebook has already done for our personal data. The joint ownership of Libra between multiple organizations would hopefully check some of Facebook's power in these cases, but until 2020, Facebook still holds the most power in the coalition. 
 
The Libra organization's squishy structure raises questions about its regulatory status. The Libra organization could be operating like a sort of shadow bank, where it functions like a bank but is not regulated like one [(CPO)](https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-could-have-profound-implications-for-personal-privacy/). Libra's regulatory arrangement has alarmed government officials. In fact, one of Libra’s founders, David Marcus, recently testified in front of the Senate and the House to defend Libra. After his testament, the House financial services committee is considering launching a “Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act” to stop large tech companies like Facebook from creating currency [(The Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/17/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-congress). Although many questions are left unanswered, I am reassured that government officials have at least taken notice of the enormous impact Libra could have. Some even think that Libra will not become a reality due to pushback from regulatory institutions, but I am hesitant to believe that given the power of its leading organizations. 
 
A global digital currency would solve pains felt by a wide number of stakeholders. However, the details of it's execution are tricky. I hypothesize that having Libra run by Facebook and major for-profit companies might not result in the best outcome for everyone, especially for the most vulnerable groups. I understand, though, that Facebook might be one of the few organizations with a large enough reach to even make Libra work. Still, I am excited to see how smaller startups (such as [DepFi](https://depfi.com/)) develop similar systems and compete with Libra to create even better outcomes for the consumer. 
 
Libra is a revolutionary idea. Hopefully if accessibility and ethicality are prioritized in its execution, the core mission behind it can become a reality.
